# arch_description
This program is intended to be used to manage simple archival descriptions. To be sure, there are already sophisticated free tools like [ICA Atom](https://wiki.ica-atom.org/Main_Page) available to this aim; however, to my knowledge, they suffer from a lack of ability to easily generate reports adapted to local conditions, and as a result, archivists and other people who are working with smaller archives and who lack access to proprietary multi-user tools are often stuck with awkward word-processing or spreadsheet templates.

The user and database interfaces are based on [Camelot](http://www.python-camelot.com/) and use SQLite as a database backend. Reports are generated using easily customizable [Jinja2](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2) templates and [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) (for full archival descriptions in DOCX, TeX or PDF format) or the basic version of [ReportLab](http://www.reportlab.com/) (for box labels). [Pypandoc](https://github.com/bebraw/pypandoc) is used to connect with Pandoc: this package can be installed on a Mac OS X or Windows system from [prebuilt binaries](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypandoc/) which include Pandoc.

To run the program, execute `main.py` in the package root with a Python 2 interpreter. If `setup.py build` is executed on a Windows system, [cx_Freeze](http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/) is used to create a directory `build` with a subdirectory `exe.win32-2.7` which contains a Windows executable `main.exe` along with all required libraries and templates. You should be able to run this program on any modern Windows system without any further installation. However, if you want to generate descriptions (but not box labels) in PDF format directly from the program, a LaTeX distribution has to be available on the system.

Note that [EAC-CPF](http://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/) or [EAD](http://www.loc.gov/ead/) import/export are not yet implemented. The included report templates are also still rather primitive.
